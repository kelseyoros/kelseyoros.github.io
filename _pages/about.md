Welcome!

For the past 5 years, I have been working in education serving as a high school math teacher.  I've spent the last 4 years at ITW David Speer Academy, a STEM-focused campus that's part of the Noble Network of Charter Schools.  I founded two roles at Speer Academy: Honors Calculus Teacher and Honors Pre-calculus Teacher in which both curriculums I created are being used by the current occupants of those roles today.  The Honors Pre-calculus curriculum I carefully curated through analyzing standardized test standards was bought by the network to be used network-wide by incoming teachers.

Noble reminded me how powerful analytics can be and I was able to lead the network consisting of 17 campuses in SAT growth in the 2017-2018 school year.  I continuously was reaching and exceeding the student growth goals set by the school by collecting and analyzing data on Tableau, Excel, and PowerSchool daily.  I was able to inform my instruction based off the analyses conducted and experienced great success from the process.  I was asked to teach the after-school SAT course for Speer Academy Juniors and lead professional development for all Pre-calculus Teachers in the network.

My time as a high school math teacher at Speer Academy expanded my perception of what education could be and nurtured my ambition to reach out beyond the confines of the classroom to affect change on a larger scale for students and faculty alike.  My interests have evolved from setting and reaching goals in the classroom towards impacting a larger group of students by utilizing analytics to improve educational outcomes.  _However, my primary mission remains the same – provide access to exceptional and equitable education for all students._

_I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and B.A. in Integrated Math Education from Miami University, but to expand my knowledge of analytical tools and techniques I also recently earned a Certificate in Data Science and Visualization from Northwestern University._  The rigorous teacher training at Speer Academy complements the skill set I’ve acquired through the certification program and strong math background.  __I am eagerly searching to join an analytics team that is dedicated to driving improved outcomes within the education field.__
